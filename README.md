Goals
Master full-stack development and build real-world apps that solve everyday problems.
Contribute to open-source projects and grow within a dev community.
Land an internship or junior dev role to level up skills in a professional environment.
Eventually become the kind of developer people go to when stuff breaks (and when they want it done right).
